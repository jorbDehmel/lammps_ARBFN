The source code of this package draws from the QMMM package
\cite{qmmm} and the LAMMPS codebase \cite{LAMMPS} for the
framework of MPI communication. It also used the
\texttt{BROWNIAN} package and ``Extending and Modifying LAMMPS''
\cite{modifying-lammps} as a basis for force modifications.

The external interfacing of our package
is similar to the built-in LAMMPS \texttt{python} wrapper (used
to similar effect in e.g. \cite{do2024feedback}), but allows
more linguistic generality.
