We discussed the implementation of the \texttt{ARBFN} package
for LAMMPS, including a brief analysis of its performance as
simulations scaled. This package allows LAMMPS fixes which are
determined at runtime by arbitrary external ``controllers'',
either one-and-done (\texttt{arbfn/ffield}) or frame-by-frame
(\texttt{fix arbfn}). Initial testing shows that the former
performs nearly as well as unmodified LAMMPS. This package is
provided as auxiliary material with this paper.
