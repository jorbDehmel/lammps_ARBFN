% Final LAMMPS interface
Our final \texttt{LAMMPS} interface for \texttt{fix arbfn} is
exemplified by the following.

\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{code}
# Every timestep, send all atomic data and
# receive fix data.  If the controller
# takes longer than 50 ms to respond, error.
fix name_1 all arbfn maxdelay 50.0

# Every 100 timesteps, send all atomic data
# without expecting any fix data back.
fix name_2 all arbfn every 100 dumponly
\end{code}

Likewise, \texttt{fix arbfn/ffield} is shown below.
\begin{code}
# At initialization, retrieve a mesh of 101
# by 201 by 301 nodes. Every timestep,
# perform trilinear interpolation of the
# received force field.
fix name_3 all arbfn/ffield 100 200 300
\end{code}

More about the implementation of these fixes will be given in
section \ref{body}.
