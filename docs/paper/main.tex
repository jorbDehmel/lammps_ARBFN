\begin{abstract}
    When dielectric colloidal Janus particles are placed in
    pseudo-2D environments, severe wall effects come into play
    complicating the measurement of bulk motility. The efficient
    and easy implementation of semi-empirical wall-effect
    systems in LAMMPS would ease the understanding of these
    effects and possibly lead to their mitigation or control. In
    this case, the addition of arbitrary force fields onto the
    simulation space would be useful. This project introduces an
    externally-controlled arbitrary atomic forcing fix for
    LAMMPS within the existing MPI framework
    \cite{modifying-lammps} \cite{mpi-docs} \cite{lammps-docs}.
    This involves an arbitrary-language controller program being
    instantiated alongside LAMMPS in an MPI runtime, then
    communicating with all LAMMPS instances whenever the desired
    fix must be computed. The protocol communicates in JSON
    strings and assumes no linguistic properties except a valid
    MPI implementation.

\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
    We discussed the implementation of the \texttt{ARBFN}
    package for LAMMPS, including a brief analysis of its
    performance as simulations scaled. This package allows
    LAMMPS fixes which are determined at runtime by arbitrary
    external ``controllers'', either one-and-done
    (\texttt{arbfn/ffield}) or frame-by-frame
    (\texttt{fix arbfn}). Initial testing shows that the former
    performs nearly as well as unmodified LAMMPS, while the
    latter performs about 2 orders of magnitude worse. The
    package is provided as supplementary material with this
    paper.
