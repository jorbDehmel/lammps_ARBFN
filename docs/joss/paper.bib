    abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have found use in a wide variety of biomolecular applications, from protein folding kinetics to computational drug design to refinement of molecular structures. Two areas where users and developers frequently need to extend the built-in capabilities of most software packages are implementing custom interactions, for instance biases derived from experimental data, and running ensembles of simulations. We present a Python high-level interface for the popular simulation package GROMACS that i) allows custom potential functions without modifying the simulation package code, ii) maintains the optimized performance of GROMACS and iii) presents an abstract interface to building and executing computational graphs that allows transparent low-level optimization of data flow and task placement. Minimal dependencies make this integrated API for the GROMACS simulation engine simple, portable and maintainable. We demonstrate this API for experimentally-driven refinement of protein conformational ensembles.LGPLv2.1 source and instructions are available at https://github.com/kassonlab/gmxapi.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

ABSTRACT = {LAMMPS is a powerful simulator originally developed for molecular dynamics that, today, also accounts for other particle-based algorithms such as DEM, SPH, or Peridynamics. The versatility of this software is further enhanced by the fact that it is open-source and modifiable by users. This property suits particularly well Discrete Multiphysics and hybrid models that combine multiple particle methods in the same simulation. Modifying LAMMPS can be challenging for researchers with little coding experience. The available material explaining how to modify LAMMPS is either too basic or too advanced for the average researcher. In this work, we provide several examples, with increasing level of complexity, suitable for researchers and practitioners in physics and engineering, who are familiar with coding without been experts. For each feature, step by step instructions for implementing them in LAMMPS are shown to allow researchers to easily follow the procedure and compile a new version of the code. The aim is to fill a gap in the literature with particular reference to the scientific community that uses particle methods for (discrete) multiphysics.},
